# PDM-PARKING-BOOKING-SYSTEM

A Parking Booking System project typically involves creating a digital solution to manage and reserve parking spaces efficiently. The project could include features like:

System Interface Design: A user-friendly layout displaying available parking spots, booking options, and navigation tools for selecting dates and times.

User Behavior: Users can browse, book, modify, or cancel parking reservations. Admins manage spot availability, pricing, and user data.

Core System Mechanics:

- Booking Spots: Users can select and reserve parking spaces for specific time slots.
- Real-Time Availability: The system shows which spots are available or booked.
- Payment Integration: Optionally includes online payment processing for reservations.
- Notifications: Sends booking confirmations and reminders.
- Admin Controls: Allows administrators to add/remove spots, monitor usage, and generate reports.

The goal is to streamline the parking process, reduce congestion, and improve user convenience.
